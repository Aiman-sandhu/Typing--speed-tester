##Typing Speed Test

A simple and interactive Typing Speed Test web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy by providing random sentences to type under a time limit.

##Features

Random Sentence Generation: Displays a new sentence each time the user starts the test.

Real-Time Input Validation: Highlights user input in green if correct and red if incorrect.

Countdown Timer: Users have 20 seconds to type the sentence.

Typing Accuracy Check: Alerts the user if their typed sentence matches the target sentence.

Words Per Minute (WPM) Calculation: Calculates typing speed at the end of the test.

Reset Functionality: Easily reset the test to start over.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the application, input field, buttons, timer, and container.

CSS: Styling of elements including sentence display, input field, buttons, and responsive design.

JavaScript: Core logic including sentence selection, timer, real-time validation, WPM calculation, and event handling.

How It Works

Click Start to display a random sentence and begin the 20-second timer.

Type the sentence into the input box. Correct typing is highlighted in green, and mistakes in red.

When the timer ends or the sentence is completed, the app checks the input against the target sentence.

Alerts are shown for typing accuracy and typing speed in WPM.

Click Reset to clear the input and timer, and start a new test.
